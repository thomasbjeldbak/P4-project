## Content, Progress and Pedagogy of the module

### Purpose
That the student learns how to design and implement a programming language and how this process can be supported by formal definitions of the language's syntax and semantics and techniques and methods for translator and / or interpreter construction.

### Reason
All software is written in a programming language and is translated or interpreted in order to be executed. Design, description and construction of Programming languages, translators, interpreters and similar tools are therefore central topics in computer science.

Therefore, the project work focuses on ensuring that the students understand important underlying concepts in the world of programming languages, why these concepts have arisen and how they are formally described and represented in an implementation. Understanding these topics is fundamental in understanding new and existing programming languages and their applications.

Furthermore, many techniques and tools, originally developed for languages and translators, are also used in other contexts in program development.

# Learning Objectives

## Knowledge
- understand and explain the basic concepts in a definition of the programming syntax and semantics of a programming language
- document knowledge of and overview of the relevant techniques and concepts in language design and translator construction
- explain the individual phases and the connection between the phases in a translator or interpreter
- explain the implementation techniques used in the constructed translator / interpreter
- use correct subject terminology

## Skills
- describe the syntax and semantics of a programming language using relevant methods
- implement a translator or interpreter for a specific programming language or for an extension to an existing programming language
- test the implemented translator or interpreter at all levels: unit, integration and acceptance test
- explain configuration management during the development of translator or interpreter
- reason computerologically about and with the concepts and techniques concerned

## Competences
- assess the use and applicability of known tools and techniques for the definition and implementation of programming languages
- understand and explain how concrete linguistic concepts are represented at driving times and in formal semantics
